# Overview
This repository contains the bioinformatics workflows used in the eWHALE project across project partners to analyze metabarcoding data produced by high-throughput sequencing of various target regions (12S, 16S, COI, 18S).

# Data Availability
Metabarcoding labwork is currently underway and therefore, there is no publishable data yet. When available, raw sequencing data and associated metadata will be uploaded to an open-access repository (GenBank & Figshare) and linked here.
